# Exchange Allied Settlements (And Make Allies Confederate)
This is a Total War: Warhammer 3 mod that adds in a user interface that allows you to transfer settlements from one ally to another, or force two allies of the same race to confederate together. This is useful for strengthening your preferred allies, consolidating your vassals into one favored faction, or just for creating aesthetically pleasing borders between your neighbors.

You do this by pressing a button on the top left of the UI that leads to a menu that displays displays two dropdown lists of allies. You can then select any city to transfer to another ally. You can only move one city at a time with this system, and you can give away your own faction's cities but not receive your allies' cities.

You must be allied with both factions for this to work. You can be Defensive Allies, be Military Allies, or have Vassalized the respective factions for them to count as allies. The option to confederate the giving faction into the receiving faction will appear if both factions are the same race.

There is no diplomatic relations effect for transferring settlements between allies, although you get a diplomatic bonus for giving away your own settlements. You can not gift settlements to yourself using this system, as this is easily exploitable. If you want to do this, then you can use the Exchange All Settlements Cheat Mod to do so.
