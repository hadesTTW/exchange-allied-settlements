# Exchange All Settlements Cheat Mod
This is a Total War: Warhammer 3 cheat mod that adds in a user interface that allows you to transfer settlements from one faction to another, or force two allies of the same race to confederate together.

You do this by pressing a button on the top left of the UI that leads to a menu that displays two dropdown lists of factions. You can then select any city to transfer to another faction. The option to confederate the giving faction into the receiving faction will appear if both factions are the same race.

There is no diplomatic relations effect for transferring settlements between factions. If you want a balanced game, then you can use the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3651393085]Exchange Allied Settlements mod[/url] instead.
