# Exchange Allied Settlements
This is a Total War: Warhammer 3 mod that adds in a user interface that allows the user to transfer settlements from one ally to another. This is useful for strengthening your preferred allies, consolidating your vassals into one favored faction, or just for creating aesthetically pleasing borders between your neighbors.

You do this by pressing a button on the top left of the UI that leads to a menu that displays a dropdown list of your allies. You can then select any city to transfer to another ally. You can only move one city at a time with this system, and you can gift the last remaining settlement of an ally to another ally.

You must be allied with both factions for this to work. You can be Defensive Allies, be Military Allies, or have Vassalized the respective factions for them to count as allies.

There is no diplomatic relations effect for transferring settlements. By default you can not gift settlements to yourself using this system,as this is easily exploitable. You can enable doing so using Mod Configuration Tool if you are fine with an unbalanced game.

Credit to Freya's Trade Any Settlement mod for the idea and base code for this mod.
